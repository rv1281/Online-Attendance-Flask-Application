# Online Attendance Flask Application

This is a basic Flask-based application that allows a teacher to sign up, log in, add students, and mark their attendance.

The application uses HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap for designing the user interface. Bootstrap provides a responsive and user-friendly design which makes the application easily accessible on various devices and screen sizes.


## Tech Stack

The Online Attendance Flask Application uses the following technologies:

- Flask: a micro web framework for Python
- Flask-Login: a Flask extension that provides user session management
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: a Flask extension that provides support for SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python
- SQLAlchemy: a SQL toolkit and ORM library for Python
- Werkzeug: a WSGI utility library for Python used by Flask as the underlying technology for the development server and debugger
## Installation

Install my-project with npm

- Clone the repository to your local machine

```python
    git clone https://github.com/[username]/Online-Attendance-Flask-Application.git
```
- Create a virtual environment and activate it

```python
    python3 -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate
```
- Install the required packages
```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Set the environment variables
```python
    export FLASK_APP=app
    export FLASK_ENV=development
```
- Run the application
```python
    flask run
```
    
## Usage
After running the application, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000. From there, you can sign up as a teacher and log in to the application. You will then be able to add students and mark their attendance.
The application has a simple user interface that allows the teacher to add students, view their profiles, and mark their attendance. The attendance information is stored in a SQLite database, which is managed using SQLAlchemy.

The Flask-Login module is used to handle user authentication, and users can log in with their email address and password. The application also provides a secure password hashing mechanism using the Werkzeug library.

To run the application, simply install the required packages using pip, and then run the app.py file. The application will be available at http://localhost:5000.

It's a simple project that can be used as a starting point for a more complex online attendance system. With some modifications and additional features, it can be turned into a full-fledged application that can be used by schools, colleges, or any other organizations to manage their student attendance.
## Database
The application uses SQLite as its database and creates the database automatically as soon as the main.py script is run. The teacher's name, email, and password are stored in the database upon sign up, and the students' names and roll numbers are added to the database when the teacher logs in and adds them. The attendance is also stored in the database.
